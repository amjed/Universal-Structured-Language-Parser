A java software aimed to be a plugin in Web Applications that parses structured languages and invokes defined functions to consume the parsed data. The parsing is defined as seperate input languages allowing the system to catter for multiple languages concurrently. A queriable semantic network is also available common to all input languages that catters for the dynamic portions of the system's knowledge.

Currently, the input languages are defined as XML files, and made available to the system at startup. The semantic network is also defined as an XML file which is re-loaded by the system whenever the system detects any changes made, hence allowing the semantic network to be updated on-the-fly. It is hoped that in future, the language definitions and semantic network will be changed to database-based instead of file-based storage, with a GUI frontend to edit. The system currently doesn't support parsing recursive structured languages, like SQL SELECT statements containing other SQL SELECT statements. It is hoped that this too will change in the future.
